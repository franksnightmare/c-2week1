-Throwing by value, catching by value:
Throwing object 'main object'by value
Caught exception by value
Hello by 'local object' (copy)  (copy) // 2 copies are found

-Throwing by value catching by reference:
Throwing object 'main object'by value
Caught exception by reference
Hello by 'local object' (copy) // 1 copy is found

The '(copy)' is appended by the copy constructor, so atleast 1 copy is made
by throwing an object.

'Throw' throws the original exception. An exception is rethrown when it is
not caught yet in the present try-block level, then the exception will be
retrown to a higher level until it is caught.
That means that the exception is handled and will be inactivated.
